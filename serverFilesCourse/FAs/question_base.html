Construct a DFA that accepts the following language:

*{{{params.language_description}}}*

#### Instructions

Your code should define the finite automata `fa` by providing the states, input symbols, transitions, initial state, and accepting states. Note that you can use any type that you want for the states, as long as it's hashable. For example, you can have the states be integers, strings, tuples, etc. You can even mix different types within the same DFA/NFA, for example: `states = {5, (3, "even"), "FAIL"}` is perfectly fine.

Here is an example of how you would define a DFA that accepts all strings in $0^*1^*$:

```python
from automata.fa.dfa import DFA

states = {'notSeen1', 'seen1', 'fail'}
input_symbols = {'0', '1'}

transitions = {
    'notSeen1': {'0': 'notSeen1', '1': 'seen1'},
    'seen1': {'0': 'fail', '1': 'seen1'},
    'fail': {'0': 'fail', '1': 'fail'}
}

initial_state = 'notSeen1'
accepting_states = {'notSeen1', 'seen1'}

fa = DFA(states=states, input_symbols=input_symbols, transitions=transitions,
         initial_state=initial_state, final_states=accepting_states)
```

In some cases, you may wish to define the DFA mathematically instead of writing out all of the states and transitions manually. For example, here is a DFA which accepts all strings that have at least 5 ones *or* have a total length congruent to 2 mod 3:

```python
from automata.fa.dfa import DFA

states = {(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(3)}
# Equivalent to {(i, j) | 0 <= i < 6, 0 <= j < 3}, or {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} x {0, 1, 2}

# i tracks the number of ones seen so far but stops incrementing once we reach 5,
# because we don't care about any additional ones. j tracks the current length mod 3.

input_symbols = {'0', '1'}

def delta(q, a):
    (i, j) = q
    if a == '0':
        return (i, (j + 1) % 3)
    else:
        return (min(i + 1, 5), (j + 1) % 3)

# This precomputes the output of the delta function on
# all pairs of inputs so that future lookups will be O(1)
transitions = {q: {a: delta(q, a) for a in input_symbols} for q in states}

initial_state = (0, 0)
accepting_states = {(i, j) for (i, j) in states if i == 5 or j == 2}
# Equivalent to {(i, j) âˆˆ Q | i = 5 or j = 2}

fa = DFA(states=states, input_symbols=input_symbols, transitions=transitions,
         initial_state=initial_state, final_states=accepting_states)
```

{{#params.is_nfa}}
Also, note that `{}` creates an empty dictionary, not a set. In order to create an empty set, use `set()`.

##### Debugging Tips

If you get an error that looks like the one below, that probably means your `delta` function returned a state which isn't in the set of states you specified for your DFA.
```
automata.base.exceptions.InvalidStateError: end state __ for transition on __ is not valid
```

Also, you might find it useful to simulate your DFA on a specific input and see what state it is in after reading each symbol, which you can do using the code provided below:
```python
try:         
    for q in fa.read_input_stepwise(some_arbitrary_string):
        print(q)
except:
    pass
```
